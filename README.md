## ðŸš€ Project Overview
This project was completed as part of a **Project-Based Internship** at **Home Credit Indonesia**, where we were tasked with developing an **end-to-end Machine Learning model** for credit scoring. The objective was to improve **loan approval decisions** by predicting a customer's ability to repay a loan.

By leveraging statistical methods and **Machine Learning algorithms**, we aimed to maximize the **potential of Home Credit's data**, ensuring that creditworthy customers are **not mistakenly rejected** and that loans are provided with appropriate **terms and repayment plans**.

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights
- **Top Features Influencing Loan Repayment:**
  - **AMT_ANNUITY**: Total annuity in the range of **20k-30k** significantly impacts repayment ability.
  - **DEF_60_CNT_SOCIAL_CIRCLE & DEF_30_CNT_SOCIAL_CIRCLE**: Number of times a customer defaulted in their **social circle**.
  - **FLAG_DOCUMENT_3**: Presence of specific documents in customer applications.
  - **INCOME_UNEMPLOYED**: Correlation between employment status and repayment behavior.
- Logistic Regression was chosen as one of the models to meet the **internship requirement** and provide a strong baseline for interpretability.
- A combination of **feature engineering** and **data preprocessing** played a crucial role in improving the accuracy of predictions.
